## Installation for Windows

The straight-forward way to installing `oc` on your system is to install by downloading the binary.
This is what we are going to do step by step:

1. First, download `oc`. The following URL directly points to the latest stable `oc` version:

   <https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-windows.zip>

1. Unzip the downloaded archive with a ZIP program.
1. Move the `oc` binary to a directory that is on your `PATH`.

   To check your `PATH`, open the command prompt and execute the following command:

   ```
   C:\> path
   ```

   {{% /alert %}}

1. [Verify your installation](../04/).
